# Godot-folder-structure-sh
A little bash script to create godot project structure for development

# Instructions
Just put the script on the folder you want to create the folder structure and run it
WARN: the script will self destruct after completion

Remember to change the execution permissions with

chmod +x

# Notes

The script initializes a git repo by default.

I don't think thi is the best and productive project structure for development, but 
is the one that I feel comfortable working with and is based on some structures I 
saw on the web.

If you have another structure you wanna add feel free to include it here :)


the src folder is where the main godot project will be when you create it in GODOT

you must have git installed
